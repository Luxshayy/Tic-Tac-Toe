## 🧠 How the AI Works

The AI follows a rule-based strategy:
1. Plays a winning move if available
2. Blocks the opponent’s winning move
3. Takes the center if free
4. Chooses a corner
5. Picks a random available cell

This makes the AI challenging while keeping the logic readable and beginner-friendly.
